## This session: the post Drafts

Your working guidance is `workspace/instructions/post-drafts.md`.
Before this session the launcher read the 14-day kit from Mandu, worked out which calendar days this run prepares post Drafts for, and fixed the Product's code to one commit for claim checks.
Once the last session has ended, it checks every post Draft and queues a post only for one that passes.
This session writes the post Drafts; the Filming session, which comes after it, writes each day's edit record to the Draft you leave, so write no edit record here.

Steps:

1. Write a post Draft for every calendar day the brief's Post Drafts table lists, except a day it shows as approved or open with nothing to change, as "Writing a post Draft" describes.
   Write each listed day's Draft even when the brief says an open checklist line or a brand rule will block it: the launcher then blocks it with the rule named, the Founder sees why, and the Draft is ready the moment the package changes.
   Read the kit files the brief names, the brand guidelines, and the Product's code at the commit the brief gives.
   The session is not finished until every listed day has a Draft, or your summary says why it has none.
2. Check your post Drafts with the brief's check-drafts command, and any item you wrote with its check-incoming command.
   A Draft blocked by the package itself (a frozen Hook that fails a brand rule or says the app does something no code supports, or an open checklist line) stays as the package requires: never change a Hook, signal, or kill criterion to pass a check; write a package-change proposal that cites both sides instead, as "Writing an item" describes, unless one is already open or decided, or an earlier session of this run already wrote it.
   A proposal that would change a Hook, signal, or kill criterion is a proposal for a new Angle: it declares `new_angle: yes` and needs sourced pain.

In your summary, say which Drafts you wrote and what check-drafts said of each.

## Writing a post Draft

Write each day's Draft as the file `day-NN.md` (such as `day-03.md`) in the Drafts folder the brief names, with your file-editing tool, holding exactly these parts in this order:

```markdown
---
draft: post
product: RepToday
window: 1
day: 3
angle: P03
pair: AB-2
leg: A
---

# <the day's asset, as the calendar names it>

## Hook

<the frozen Hook from the brief, word for word>

## Beats

### Beat 1 (hook): 0-3s

- Visual action: <what the viewer sees happen>
- Spoken line: <what is said aloud, or none>
- On-screen text: <the frozen Hook, word for word>

### Beat 2: 3-9s

- Visual action: <...>
- Spoken line: <... or none>
- On-screen text: <... or none>

## TikTok

### Caption

<the frozen Hook as the first line, then the rest of the caption>

### Hashtags

<#tags separated by spaces, or none>

### Alt text

<a plain description of what the video shows>

## YouTube Shorts

### Title

<the frozen Hook>

### Description

<the same text as the TikTok caption>

### Hashtags

<the same as TikTok's>

### Alt text

<the same as TikTok's>

## Claims

- Claim: <a behavioral claim the Draft makes, in plain words>
  Code: `<path in the Product's repository>:<line>`, or `:<first>-<last>` for at most 40 lines; none when no code supports the claim
  Shows: `<code copied from those lines that supports the claim>`, or none
```

- Leave out `pair` and `leg` for a day that is not an A/B pair leg.
- Number the beats from 1 with times that follow on; only beat 1 is the hook beat, starting at 0s.
- Each test platform the brief names gets one `##` section with exactly the `###` fields the brief lists for it; both carry identical content.
- The brand lint matches a word or phrase a brand rule lists as whole words, whether spaces, hyphens, dashes, or underscores join them.
  A hashtag runs its words together, so there the lint is stricter: a listed word or phrase blocks the Draft anywhere inside a hashtag, run together or joined by underscores, even as part of a longer word.
  So does a number or quantity that comes before an invented-proof term inside one hashtag.
  When a hashtag is blocked this way, choose another hashtag.
- An A/B leg differs from its other leg only in the Hook: when the other leg already has an open or approved post, copy its Draft and change only the Hook's lines; the hook beat's visual action and spoken line may change with them, and every beat keeps its time.
  When you draft both legs in one run, write the earlier day first and copy it for the later day.
  The launcher checks the newer leg against that Draft field by field, in the order of the beats and with each beat's time, and blocks it on any other difference; it never changes the leg already posted.
- A re-cut pair is one the kit marks as a re-cut, in the pair's own section of the A/B pairs or in the calendar row of either leg.
  Each leg of a re-cut pair opens on its own Hook in the hook beat and may show the pair's other Hook in a later beat, as the pair's opening order says.
  Every beat that shows neither Hook is the same in both legs, word for word, in the same order and for the same length of time; only when it starts may move with the opening.
  In any other pair, and on a day that is not a pair leg, no beat shows another Hook.
- When text a leg must share with its other leg fails a brand rule, never reword one leg alone.
  If the other leg is not approved and the brief lists both days, reword both Drafts together, so they still match beyond the Hook.
  If the other leg is approved, leave the text as that leg has it: the launcher blocks the Draft naming the rule and tells the Founder that the pair cannot both pass until a package change or a re-cut of both legs resolves it.
  Otherwise leave the text as it is and say so in your summary.
- Give each behavioral claim (anything the video or copy says the app does, the frozen Hook included) its own item under Claims, with the lines of code at the brief's commit that support it; cut a claim no code supports.
  A claim you cannot cut, because the frozen Hook makes it or an approved leg shares its text, stays in the Draft, listed with `Code: none` and `Shows: none`.
  The launcher then blocks the Draft naming that claim, which is the outcome the Founder needs to see.
  List only the claims the Draft makes, and every one of them: the launcher can check only what you list, so never list a claim the Draft does not make, or leave one out, to pass the check.
  Shows may quote more than one of the cited lines: start each further line with two spaces, like the Code and Shows lines, and close the backtick after the last one.
- Rewrite an open day's Draft only to change it for a reason, such as a package change or the Founder's decision; an unchanged Draft keeps its item.
- A Draft the Founder rejected is not asked again until it changes: rewrite it to answer the reason the brief gives.
  A post the Founder rejected with its video is asked again once its Draft or its edit record changes; until one of them does, check-drafts reports the day as rejected.
- Write post Drafts only in the Drafts folder the brief names.
